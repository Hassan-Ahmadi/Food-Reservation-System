# Food Reservation System
A simple C++ food reservation system for university students.
This project uses files as database and the main datastructures within the prog is linked list.
This project was the final project for my advanced programming course which was on c++ and it took me 2 monthes to complete.
I hope to refactor it and design a better program later on.
